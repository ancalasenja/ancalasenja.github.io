This app generates caption for social media users (such as Instagram and Twitter) in Bahasa Indonesia using Long Short-term Memory model.

The model employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture trained by thousands of captions acquired from multiple online sources. The average accuracy of the trained model is 81.48.

Note: The trained model will be improved as the present generated sentence sometimes is a bit weird.
